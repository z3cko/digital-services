# Hardware
Overview of hardware suitable for Linux, Mac and Windows. This is a collection of gear that I personally own and have reviewed. Criteria for this list: 

* **compatibility**: hardware needs to work with Linux as well as with Mac OS X. Lab equipment should work with [SIGROK](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Main_Page).
* **open**: gear needs to be as open as possible (ideally open source hardware or fully open repair manuals available).
* **durability**: should be proven long-lasting gear.
* **reparability**: devices should be well-documented and easy to repair.
* **hackability**: devices should be hackable and extensible.
